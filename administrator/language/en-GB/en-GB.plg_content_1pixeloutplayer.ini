DESC1PIXELOUT=<h3>1Pixelout Audio Player v1.5.2</h3><p>This plugin will help stream your mp3 files.<br /><strong>Please Note:</strong> The only file format it can stream is .mp3 files in your content items or static contents.</p><p><strong>USAGE: </strong><br />- Once installed, go to plugin manager and click on 1pixeloutplayer. Publish it and click the 'save' button.<br />- To insert the audio player and show in content - Insert a line as shown below into a content item and replace your_file.mp3 with the file name of mp3 track that you want to stream. Note, a forward slash at the beginning of the path is not required.<br /><b>{audio}mp3/your_file.mp3{/audio}</b><br /><br />Put your mp3 files under the folders <b>/mp3/</b> in your webroot.<br /><br /> <strong>OPTIONS: </strong> <br /> If all audio files will be in one directory, you can define the default directory in the Plugin Parameters. For example, if <b>/mp3/</b> is defined as the default directory, insert the following into content: <br /> <b>{audio}your_file.mp3{/audio}</b> <br /> <br /> Any audio files in a subdirectory within the default directory still have to be named. For example, if <b>/mp3/</b> is the Plugin Parameters default directory and files are in <b>/mp3/january/</b>, insert the following into content: <br /> <b>{audio}january/your_file.mp3{/audio}</b><br /><br /> The default directory can be overridden by beginning the file path with a slash. For example, if <b>/mp3/</b> is the Plugin Parameters default directory and the file is in <b>/otherfiles/audio/</b>, insert the following into content: <br /> <b>{audio}/otherfiles/audio/your_file.mp3{/audio}</b> <br /><br /> It is possible to stream mp3 hosted from an external server. To do this, just use a full URL to where the mp3 is hosted: <br /><b>{audio}http://example.com/mp3/file_name.mp3{/audio}</b></p><p><strong>AUTOSTART:</strong><br />Individual MP3s can now be set to automatically play. Insert the following into content: <br /> <b>{audio autostart}your_file.mp3{/audio}</b> <br /><br />If there is more than one file on a page set to autostart, only the first one will automatically play.</p><p>Created by <a href="http://www.duvien.com/" target="_blank" title="duvien.com [opens in new window]">duvien.com</a>.</p><p>This plugin uses the audio player by <a href="http://www.1pixelout.net/?page_id=34" target="_blank" title="1pixelout [opens in new window]">1pixelout.</a></p><p><h3>Diagram for changing 1pixelout audio player colour</h3><img src="../plugins/content/1pixelout/1pixelout-player-colour-scheme.png" width="413" height="147" border="0" alt="This is a diagram for the colour scheme of the audio player's configurable parameters" /><br />The entire player colour scheme is customizable. Use the parameters you see on the right of this page to change the settings. Use a valid hexadecimal colour value such as FFFFFF or 009933.</p><p>If you don't understand hexadecimal colors, <a href="http://plaza.ufl.edu/mmcadams/color.htm" target="_blank">see this page</a>.</p><p><b>USEFUL INFO:</b><br />The Macromedia Flash player has a problem playing files that are encoded at a rate that is not a multiple of <b>11.025 kHz</b>. This effect is sometimes called the <b>&quot;chipmunk&quot; effect</b>: the file is played at double speed. <b>To avoid this, encode MP3s at 11.025 kHz, 22.050 kHz or 44.100 kHz</b>.</p><p><b>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</b> Some times after the first installation, the plugin does not pick the colour scheme to add to the audio player. You may have to go into the 1pixelout player plugin and click 'save' once.</p><p>Finally, use at your own risk and have fun.</p><p>Changelog:<br />- 25 Jun 2008 - Add new 1pixelout player (with volume control) by Duvien<br />- 25 Jun 2008 - Fixed &amp; not escaping properly (validation) by <a href="http://nathandiehl.com/" target="_blank" title="nathandiehl.com [opens in new window]">Nathan Diehl</a><br />- 21 Mar 2008 - Rewritten part of the code to add - autoplay option per file, better SEF URL compatibility, performance improvements and default path option by <a href="http://www.cloudiness.com/" target="_blank" title="cloudiness.com [opens in new window]">Art Delano</a>.<br />- 20 Feb 2008 - Minor fixes to work in both legacy and native mode on J1.5 by duvien<br />- 20 Feb 2008 - Developed for Joomla 1.5 - by L.
